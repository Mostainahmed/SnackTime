### This project is developed for custom food ordering system.

User can order their food after login to their respective credentials.

The time is restricted to 10 am to 12 pm. In this two hours they will be notified four times if they didn't order their food.

They can modify their ordered items between these two hours. They can also see what food they previously ordered.

After the times run out, users are unable to order food as the app shows them time runs out.
